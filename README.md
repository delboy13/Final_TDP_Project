# Final_TDP_Project


## What was the challenge?
The final challenged required me to create a veiwable employee table using pure Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
The user should be able to:
1. View the list of employees
2. Add a New Employee
3. Delete a specific Employee
4. Edit an Employee

Stretch goals include adding a filter capability.

## How i expected the challenge to go?
I expected this to be a very difficult challange. The 4 weeks training was a fast paced, intense and alien 4 weeks, So being able to combine that all together to create a dynamically functioning table using only HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT will be difficult. I will need to grasp the basic concepts and brings these together to get something that works. I expect to need help, alot however i will endevour to only call on help when absolutely needed. 

## What went well?
I was able to pull together the rescources i had at hand such as google, revision notes, reading and practice to quickly pull together the basic structure of what i was hoping to acheive. 
I was able to sit down before rushing into the project to plan each individual step i needed to think about and then take and i planned my approach effectively. 
I understood more than i gave myself credit for.

## What didnt go as planned?
Naming variables and files etc got me extremely confused at times which did not help me follow the logic therefore came to an empass with functionality. 
Needed some help to get over the fina few hurdles. The main obstacle was to get a specific record and update its values.

## Possible improvements?
More revision in my own time and own pace to fully appreciate how object orientation works.
putting more thought into naming variables, attributes, functions and files to make it easier to follow my own logic. Need to try and avoid random names like "Dwarf".
